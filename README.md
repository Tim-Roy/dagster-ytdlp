# Dagster + YT-DLP

This is the source code for [YT-DLP](https://github.com/YT-DLP/YT-DLP) orchestration with Dagster. Requires Dagster to run. Optional scripts to sync with a NAS and delete older videos are also included.

This was a personal project that will not run without modifying source code or your local host. Below are suggested configurations.

## Set-up

1. Dagster must be configured to allow runs to be launched in new containers, follow the [tutorial](https://docs.dagster.io/deployment/guides/docker#launching-runs-in-containers) if needed.
1. 3 environent variables must be set both for this docker container AND the dagster container:
    1. YT_DOWNLOADS_PATH - the location where downloads are to be written. Update docker-compose for the host path as well.
    1. YT_SUBS_PATH - the path to the subscription config YAML. Update docker-compose for the host path as well.
    1. LOG_HOME, or remove logging if not interested.
    1. YT_NAS_PATH - needed for deleting videos tagged as ephemeral. Only needed for the `delete_ephemeral_yt_videos_job` job.
1. A back-end PostgreSQL database is used in this setup for maintaining a download history. To continue using this approach, the host, username, password, port and database must also be provided, see *./ytdl/config/database.py* for specifics. *./proc/dag_ytdlp.sql* contains the proper schema.
1. The scripts directory contains shell and systemd scripts for syncing data and cleaning the downloads directory.
1. The subscriptions YAML should follow the subscription_example.yaml format:
    - Must contain a URL
    - Optionally can contain the following 3 boolean options:
        - ephemeral (To be deleted after 90 days)
        - best_format (Override default and download best format available)
        - use_playlist_index (Use playlist index instead of MMDD for episode naming)
1. The Dagster service *workspace.yaml* must contain an entry for the corresponding code. For example, using the example DOCKERFILE with 4300, the following would need to be added:

```
load_from:
  - grpc_server:
      host: dagster_ytdlp
      port: 4300
      location_name: dagster_ytdlp_server
```

## Dagster Jobs

The following jobs are available when deployed:

#### refresh_yt_subscriptions

This is the main job that downloads new videos from the subscriptions list.

#### download_from_url

Manually download a single video from a URL.

#### backfill_yt_channel

Manually backfill a channel, allowing for a custom span of videos.

#### delete_ephemeral_yt_videos_job

Delete videos more than 90 days old from channels that are tagged as ephemeral.
